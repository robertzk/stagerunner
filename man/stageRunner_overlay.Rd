\title{Overlaying a stageRunner object is taking another stageRunner object
with similar stage names and adding the latter's stages as terminal stages
to the former (for example, to support tests).}
\usage{
stageRunner_overlay(other_runner, label = NULL, flat = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{other_runner}{stageRunner. Another stageRunner from which to overlay.}

\item{label}{character. The label for the overlayed stageRunner. This refers
to the name the former will get wrapped with when appended to the
stages of the current stageRunner. For example, if \code{label = 'test'},
and a current terminal node is unnamed, it will becomes
\code{list(current_node, test = other_runner_node)}.}

\item{flat}{logical. Whether to use the \code{stageRunner$append} method to
overlay, or simply overwrite the given \code{label}. If \code{flat = TRUE},
you must supply a \code{label}. The default is \code{flat = FALSE}.}
