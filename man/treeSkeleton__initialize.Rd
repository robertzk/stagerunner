\usage{
treeSkeleton__initialize(object, parent_caller = "parent",
  children_caller = "children")
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{ANY. If a reference class object, then
  \code{parent_caller} and \code{children_caller} will
  refer to reference class methods.  If an attribute on the
  object with names of \code{children_caller} and
  \code{parent_caller} exists, those will be used.
  Otherwise, the generic methods will be used.}

  \item{parent_caller}{character. The name of the reference
  class method that returns the parent object, if the
  object was a node in a tree structure.}

  \item{children_caller}{character. The name of the
  reference class method that returns the child objects, if
  the object was a node in a tree structure.}
}

a treeSkeleton object.
}
\description{
treeSkeleton objects allow you to traverse a reference
class object as if it had a tree structure, merely by
knowing how to call parent or child nodes.
