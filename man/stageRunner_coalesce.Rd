\description{
Coalescing a stageRunner object is taking another stageRunner object
with similar stage names and replacing the latter's cached environments
with the former's.
}
\note{
coalescing is ill-defined for stageRunner with unnamed stages,
   since it is impossible to tell when a stage has changed.
